I am passionate about building robots that are intuitive to interact with for complex and advanced manipulation tasks.

I enjoy solving challenging problems that require analytical thinking and ability to think outside the box. I would like to call myself a very hands-on person, and I am really passionate about making complex robotics systems work robustly and making state-of-the-art technologies practical and user-friendly with very intuitive user experience.

I believe collaborative, compassionate, forward-thinking teams lead to fast-paced development that offers simultaneous fulfillment of immediate milestones and construction of robust, long-term architectures.

I have experience as a software engineer, research scientist, technical lead, and applied scientist. I am also passionate about science communication.

In past lives, Iâ€¦

- led advanced numerical IK solver development for multi-arm surgical robot system at KUKA Boston R&D
- developed force and impedance control behaviors for manipulation tasks at RethinkRobotics
- did my PhD on representation and control of coordinated motion/force tasks of multi-arm and human-robot systems at Purdue ARTLab
- designed and built small-sized humanoid robots and mobile robots at Kwangwoon University in S. Korea

I am currently designing new ways of mobility at [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/).
