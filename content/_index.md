Welcome to my personal homepage! 

I enjoy solving challenging problems that require analytical thinking and ability to think outside the box. I would like to call myself a very hands-on person, and I am really passionate about making complex robotics systems work robustly and making state-of-the-art technologies practical and user-friendly with very intuitive user experience.

Here are my specialties:
- kinematics, dynamics and motion/force (and impedance) control of redundant manipulators
- simulating multi-DOF kinematics and dynamics
- whole-body motion generation of humanoid robot systems for manipulation and locomotion tasks
- coordinated motion and force control of multi-robot systems
- working with hardware (motors, sensors, actuators, microcontrollers, and small-and-full-sized humanoid robots)
