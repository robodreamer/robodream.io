I obtained my PhD at Purdue University in Electrical & Computer Engineering and in May 2016. During my PhD years, I worked as Research Assistant at [Assistive Robotics Technology Lab (ART Lab)](https://engineering.purdue.edu/artlab) directed by Prof. C. S. George Lee. In 2012-2013, I was the Control Lead for ladder climbing task in DRC-Hubo team for DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) Trials. My research interests are whole-body motion control of humanoid robots and coordinated dual-arm motion control for various manipulation tasks. I graduated from Kwangwoon University in 2009 with Summa Cum Laude (1st/109) for Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronic Engineering.
